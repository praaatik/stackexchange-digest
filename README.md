# Stack Exchange Digest

## What is this?

This is a tiny project which fetches the most recent questions from the various Stack Exchange websites.

## Why this project?

- First of all, reading questions on the Stack Exchange sites is pretty fun, most of the questions are interesting. But I could not find a place to get all the questions of all the sites which I followed, in one place. Hence, this project.
- Second, to practice my ReactJS skills which I learnt quite recently.

This project has been hosted on GitHub Pages. Link - https://praaatik.github.io/stackexchange-digest/
